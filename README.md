Machine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around. It deserves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.
**What does Machine Learning really means?**
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
**Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs** that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
